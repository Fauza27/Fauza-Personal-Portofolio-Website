## Project Overview

Developed a high-performance computer vision system for industrial quality control, capable of detecting defects in manufacturing processes with exceptional accuracy and speed.

## System Architecture

### Image Processing Pipeline
- Real-time video stream ingestion
- Preprocessing and augmentation
- Multi-model inference
- Post-processing and filtering

### Model Architecture
- Custom YOLO-based detection model
- Transfer learning from pre-trained weights
- Model quantization for edge deployment
- Ensemble predictions for critical detections

## Performance Metrics

- **Processing Speed**: Over 1000 images per second
- **Accuracy**: 99.2% on test set
- **Latency**: Less than 10ms per image
- **False Positive Rate**: Less than 0.5%

## Key Features

### Real-Time Detection
- Live video stream processing
- GPU-accelerated inference
- Batch processing optimization
- Automatic model switching based on load

### Quality Control
- Defect classification (10+ categories)
- Severity scoring
- Automated alerts and notifications
- Historical trend analysis

### Edge Deployment
- Containerized with Docker
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Offline operation capability

## Technical Implementation

```python
# Example inference pipeline
class DefectDetector:
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        self.model = load_model(model_path)
        self.preprocessor = ImagePreprocessor()
    
    async def detect(self, image):
        # Preprocess
        processed = self.preprocessor.transform(image)
        
        # Inference
        predictions = await self.model.predict(processed)
        
        # Post-process
        results = self.filter_predictions(predictions)
        
        return results
```

## Challenges Overcome

- **Latency Requirements**: Achieved less than 10ms latency through model optimization and GPU utilization
- **Accuracy vs Speed**: Balanced with ensemble methods and adaptive thresholds
- **Edge Deployment**: Optimized model size from 500MB to 50MB without accuracy loss

## Impact

- **50%** reduction in manual inspection time
- **30%** improvement in defect detection rate
- **$500K** annual cost savings
- Deployed across 5 manufacturing facilities
